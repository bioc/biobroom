Description: This package contains methods for converting standard objects
    constructed by bioinformatics packages, especially those in Bioconductor,
    and converting them to tidy data. It thus serves as a complement to the broom
    package, and follows the same the tidy, augment, glance division of tidying
    methods. Tidying data makes it easy to recombine, reshape and visualize
    bioinformatics analyses.
